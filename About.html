            <p>
                I am Jovan Simonoski, a 20 years old IT student form Resen, Macedonia.
                Born on 18<span class="sup">th</span> of January, I was a quiet kid who always enjoyed playing on his computer and exploring new things.
                I learned my first basic computer skills while trying to download different games and programs and exploring them as well.
                I also had a lot of friends who were enthusiastically using their computers, and we always shared the knowledge we gained among us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I was 6 years old, it was time to go the Elementary School and I was very excited. The school was called "Mite Bogoevski"
                and was located in the center of my hometown.
                There I had my first idea of how important science is for our everyday life, especially I loved maths and was good at it.
                I had many opportunities to participate in maths, chemistry and biology competitions. I always loved to make new friends and to be in a
                space surrounded with technology and people working with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I finished Elementary School, I was pretty sure that I wanted to study a lot of maths and science in general, so I decided the High School
                in my hometown, SOU "Car Samoil" was the right choice. There I met some of the most impressing people of my entire life. Some professors changed my life forever.
                I was part of a lot of projects and organizations connected with the school. We even formed a youth club called "Prespa Youth Club"
                and we organized few events like marathons, concerts etc.
                In those days I fell deeply in love with music and got into my first Rock N' Roll band called "Instinct". Since then, we played a lot of gigs and concerts.
                We even recorded our own songs, and we had a wonderful experience in general. Those are some moments I'll never forget.
            </p>
            <p>
                After 4 years of constantly learning and developing myself, it was time for University,
                and when it comes to that, I can say that I couldn't make
                a better choice than FINKI. The amount of happiness and joy I felt when I started cannot be described with words.
                I finally found myself and the environment I want to grow in as a person and as a professional.
            </p>
